plotmetrics - plots the box charts for gCNR values
plotROCcurve - plots the ROC according to gCNR values
statistics calculates the sensitivity and specificity of prediction for each radiologist. For now I have hard coded these values in plotROCcurve to get the dots and crosses in the curve. Ideally they should be automated.
